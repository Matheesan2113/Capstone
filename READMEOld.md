# Capstone

This is the intial README render for Capstone EB04 for Ryerson University. 
The work here is done on a twitter dataset that was transformed and loaded asa much smaller CSV file.
The link to the CSV file will be provided if asked for as it's too large to host here. When running with the CSV file, 
please be sure to change the link in the code by "Ctrl-F" to find "pd.read_CSV" so that you can change the location
of the downloaded CSV file. The results you find at the bottom will be for specified clusters.
